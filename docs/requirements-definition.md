# Requirements Definition Document

## 1. Requirements Elicitation and Analysis

### 1.1 Source Requirements
**User Request:** "food app"

**Requirements Analysis:**
The user request for a "food app" has been interpreted as a system for restaurant owners to manage their business and menu, and for customers to browse restaurants and their offerings. This implies a multi-user system with at least two roles: Restaurant Owner and Customer. The core functionality will revolve around creating and managing restaurant profiles and their corresponding menu items.

### 1.2 System Description
**System Purpose:**
The system, named "PlatePerfect", will serve as a digital platform for restaurants. It enables restaurant owners to create a profile for their establishment, manage a digital menu, and showcase their offerings to a wider audience. The core purpose is to provide a simple, centralized management tool for restaurant owners and a discovery platform for potential customers.

**System Scope:**
*   **Included:** User authentication (signup/login), management of restaurant profiles (create, read, update, delete), management of menu items per restaurant (create, read, update, delete), public viewing of all restaurants and their menus.
*   **Excluded:** Online ordering, reservations, payment processing, customer reviews, delivery logistics.

**System Environment:**
The system is a web-based application designed for modern desktop and mobile browsers. The frontend will be a React Single Page Application (SPA), and the backend will be powered by the Manifest framework, deployed in a containerized cloud environment.

### 1.3 Business Context
**Problem Statement:**
Independent restaurant owners often lack the technical resources or budget to create and maintain their own professional-looking website with an easily updatable digital menu. This makes it difficult to attract online customers and communicate their offerings effectively.

**Solution Overview:**
PlatePerfect provides a no-code solution using Manifest and React. Restaurant owners can sign up, create their restaurant's profile, and add/edit menu items through a simple dashboard. The platform automatically generates public-facing pages for their restaurant and menu, solving the problem without requiring technical expertise from the user.

**Target Users:**
*   **Restaurant Owners:** Small to medium-sized restaurant owners who need a simple digital presence and menu management tool.
*   **General Public/Customers:** Individuals looking to browse local restaurants and view their menus online.

## 2. Requirements Specification

### 2.1 User Requirements

#### 2.1.1 User Stories
**US-001:** As a restaurant owner, I want to sign up for an account so that I can list my restaurant on the platform.
**US-002:** As a restaurant owner, I want to create and edit my restaurant's profile (name, description, address) so that customers have accurate information.
**US-003:** As a restaurant owner, I want to add, update, and remove menu items for my restaurant so that my menu is always current.
**US-004:** As a user (customer or owner), I want to view a list of all restaurants on the platform so that I can discover new places to eat.
**US-005:** As a user, I want to view the detailed menu of a specific restaurant so that I can see what they offer.

#### 2.1.2 User Scenarios
*   **Scenario 1 (Owner Onboarding):** A new restaurant owner visits the site, signs up for an account, logs in, is presented with a dashboard, and creates a new profile for their restaurant. They then proceed to add several menu items with descriptions and prices.
*   **Scenario 2 (Customer Discovery):** A potential customer visits the site, browses the list of public restaurants, clicks on one that looks interesting, and views its complete menu to decide if they want to visit.

#### 2.1.3 Acceptance Criteria
*   **AC-001:** A new user can successfully create an account using an email and password.
*   **AC-002:** An authenticated user with the 'owner' role can access a dashboard to manage their restaurants.
*   **AC-003:** An owner can only edit or delete restaurants that they created.
*   **AC-004:** Any visitor (authenticated or not) can see the list of all restaurants.
*   **AC-005:** Menu items are correctly associated with and displayed under their parent restaurant.

### 2.2 System Requirements

#### 2.2.1 Functional Requirements
**CF-001: User Authentication**
- **Description:** The system must provide user registration and login functionality.
- **User Benefit:** Secures user data and enables role-based access.
- **Priority:** High

**CF-002: Restaurant Management**
- **Description:** Authenticated users (owners) can perform CRUD operations on their own restaurant entities.
- **User Benefit:** Allows owners to control their business's digital presence.
- **Priority:** High

**CF-003: Menu Item Management**
- **Description:** Restaurant owners can perform CRUD operations on menu items associated with their restaurants.
- **User Benefit:** Enables owners to keep their digital menu up-to-date.
- **Priority:** High

**Entity Management:**
*   **User:** Signup (public), Read (self), Update (self).
*   **Restaurant:** Create (authenticated users), Read (public), Update (owner only), Delete (owner only).
*   **MenuItem:** Create (restaurant owner), Read (public), Update (restaurant owner), Delete (restaurant owner).

**Business Rules:**
*   A user must have the 'owner' role to create a restaurant.
*   A restaurant must be owned by one and only one user.
*   A menu item must belong to one and only one restaurant.
*   Restaurant and menu item data is publicly readable.

#### 2.2.2 Non-Functional Requirements
**Performance Requirements:**
- **Response Time:** Web pages should load in under 3 seconds on a standard broadband connection.
- **Concurrent Users:** The system should support up to 100 concurrent users during its initial phase.

**Security Requirements:**
- **Authentication:** User authentication is mandatory for all data creation and modification actions.
- **Data Protection:** Passwords must be hashed. Data access is controlled by backend policies based on ownership.

**Usability Requirements:**
- **User Interface:** The UI must be clean, intuitive, and responsive, adapting to both desktop and mobile screen sizes.
- **Accessibility:** The application should adhere to basic web accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 A).

#### 2.2.3 Technical Constraints
**Platform Requirements:**
- **Frontend:** React with Vite and Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend:** Manifest framework with auto-generated APIs.
- **Database:** SQLite (development) / PostgreSQL (production).
- **Deployment:** Cloud hosting with container deployment.

**Integration Requirements:**
- **Admin Panel:** Utilize the built-in Manifest admin interface for administrative tasks.
- **API Documentation:** Rely on the auto-generated OpenAPI documentation from Manifest.
- **Authentication:** Use the Manifest built-in authentication system.

#### 2.2.4 System Functions
**Primary Functions:**
*   Create Account
*   Login/Logout
*   Create/Update/Delete Restaurant
*   Create/Update/Delete MenuItem
*   View All Restaurants
*   View Restaurant Menu

**Supporting Functions:**
*   User Session Management
*   Ownership-based Data Authorization

## 3. Requirements Validation

### 3.1 Completeness Check
The documented requirements cover all aspects derived from the initial "food app" request, including user roles, data entities, and core functionalities for both restaurant owners and customers.

### 3.2 Consistency Check
Requirements are consistent. For example, the requirement for owners to manage their own restaurants (US-002) is supported by the system requirement for ownership-based data policies (CF-002).

### 3.3 Feasibility Assessment
All specified requirements are technically feasible using the Manifest and React stack. The chosen features (authentication, CRUD, relationships, policies) are core capabilities of the Manifest framework.

### 3.4 Traceability
Each requirement can be traced back to the high-level goal of creating a functional food application. User stories directly address the needs of restaurant owners and customers, which are then broken down into specific functional and system requirements.
